            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                                
                                This is a game I made in HTML5, it works on both mobile and desktop web browsers and was created when mobile web browsers first started supporting HTML5/hardware acceleration in web browsers. The game uses hardware acceleration on any device capable of it, but falls back on software rendering to function on older devices. The gameplay is pretty simple but has an addictive element to it once you get going.   
                                </p>
                                
            <h2>How it was made</h2>
            <p>
                                
                                This game was created using javascript and the Phaser library for graphics. Before this project I already had experience with javascript, but this was my first time using the language for a larger and performance-critical application. I used performance profiling tools and a few different techniques to get the game to run at a decent framerate even on older hardware without hardware-acceleration from a gpu and find + get rid of any memory leaks in my javascript. I focused on architecting a clean and understandable code structure with javascripts tricky prototypal-OOP, and applying the performance-conscious coding skills I learned from my earlier Java and C++ projects in javascript.
                                
                                </p>
            <h2>What I did/what I learned</h2>
            <p>
                I created everything on this project. The only code that wasn't written by me was the Phaser library I used for graphics(although I actually did <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/box2d">contribute</a> to phaser later on). This was the original project that got my feet wet with serious javascript coding, beyond just making slideshows/carousels for websites and using basic jquery functions. The development of this game took me from understanding the syntax of javascript, to understanding the language itself and having a deep grasp of its inner-workings and its strengths and weaknesses, which give me the insight to understand the most efficient and effective way to craft javascript code and use it to impose my will onto webpages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I even created all the graphics, except for the background texture, myself. I used to always leave the graphical aspect of my creations to someone else because I thought I had no talent for it, but this was the first project where I decided to take a shot at it myself and work on developing my graphics/design skills. Although the graphics aren't <i>horrible</i>, they completely lack any kind of style, and my design skills have come a long way since then.
